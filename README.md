# Android Finance Tracker

---

## Overview

This project explores the use of flutter and dart to create a basic finance tracking app. The project aims to be a learning tool for myself to learn android development, while also serving as a replacement for tracking my finances using a basic spreadsheet.

The app allows the user to set a monthly budget, and then add transactions over time. Transactions can be dated to any time, and recurring daily/weekly/monthly payments can be easily set up. Basic finacial insights are provided, such as average daily spending, spending over the span of the current month, and amount of spending per category. These insights update as new transactions are added. The users transactions can be viewed from a calendar, or in a list format.
